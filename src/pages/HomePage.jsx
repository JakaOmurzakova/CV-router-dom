      <h5>My Childhood</h5>
      <p style={{ marginLeft: "50px", marginRight: "50px" }}>
        I was born on a cold winter night, when even time seemed to stand still,
        in my native Bennington, Oklahoma. I do not remember much of my early
        childhood, but my mom said I was a very active, curious, and
        communicative child. I would ask dozens of questions each minute, even
        without waiting for the answers. I suppose this is why my parents
        offered me books and educational movies as early as my third birthday.I

      <h5>Who I Am</h5>
      <p style={{ marginLeft: "50px", marginRight: "50px" }}>
        Fortunately, my thirst for knowledge did not come to an end when I was
        at school. I was passionate about history and science. This passion
        helped me gain a profound knowledge of these areas, and I was admitted
        to the college of my dreams. Today, I am a student at a law school, and
        I feel very happy about it.

      <h5>My Goals</h5>
      <p style={{ marginLeft: "50px", marginRight: "50px" }}>
        Of course, I understand that life is not just a bed of roses, and
        challenges and hardships are an integral element of life. Since my
        parents could not help me cover my college expenses in full, paying off
        my student loan has become an important challenge for me. I combine a
        part-time job and full-time study to earn my living and my education. I
        feel triumphant at the beginning of every month when I receive my salary
        and plan how I will spend my money.
